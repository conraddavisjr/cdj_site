    <p>Sandra Visnapuu of Visnapuu Design was on a mission to expand her business through the web. However there was one major road block, her original website was outdated, disconnected, and poorly represented her distinguished portfolio. I preposed to redesign and build her a new website that was beautiful, portable, and easily updated by her or any content editor. I resolved the critical issues her old site had with SEO and after 1 year post launch of her website, it has experienced a 250% increase in visits.
