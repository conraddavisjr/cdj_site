        	After a full audit of her original site, I gathered its design elements and 
            composed a more enriched color pallete while maintaining its elements.

                <div class="color-description"> When placed within blocks side-by-side, these colors don't seem so bad. However, the old site overused the gray; it was used for backgrounds as well as type, then jumped to the hot pink for text in the navigation. The transitions were harsh, but Sandra's brand is based on grace... I had my work cut out. </div>

                <div class="color-description"> I softend the hot pink and grabbed some additional shades that were color picked from flowers in Sandra's garden. I lightened the gray and added black for a proper reading experience throughout her site.</div>
